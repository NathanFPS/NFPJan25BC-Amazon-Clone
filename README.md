⚠️ Firebase Deployment Note
---------------------------

This app requires the paid **Firebase Blaze Plan** to support Stripe payments, as Stripe API requests depend on outgoing network access — which is disabled on the Spark (free) plan.

The app and payment logic should work as intended once deployed with Blaze.
